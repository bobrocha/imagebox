# Imagebox
This is my first PHP project!

It was done as part of school. It's a basic PHP application where you can upload personal pictures give them names and tags. If you tag a photo #beach, #dog, #park etc. you can later search for photos with that tag

The project demonstrates the use of the following:

* Sessions
* Ajax via jQuery
* Object Oriented Programming
* Prevention of SQL Injection
* SQL
* INNER JOIN's
* Subqueries
* Opening and saving files
* DOM manupulation or traversal via jQuery
* Image manipulation
* Foreign key's
